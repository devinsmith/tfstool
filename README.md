tfstool
=======

What is this?
-------------

This is a tool that can interact with Microsoft TFS in a similar way that
tf.exe can on Windows. In fact, if you are using Microsoft Windows you should
stick with that tool. We hope to provide a subset of that functionality on
non-Microsoft systems.

Building
--------

Unknown at this point.

Configuration
-------------

Your TFS server, username, and password should be placed in a ~/.tfstoolrc
file.

License
-------
